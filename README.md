The following are the specific implementations that have been carried out for each Learning Path:
-	Machine Learning: The process of preprocessing data, making models, converting to TF Lite, is done in Google Colab, Using Transfer Learning to train the model to be faster in development, Tesseract becomes a model that has been trained, then at the end, a new layer is added to match the desired data and the Model will be saved and converted into TF Lite, which can then be used on Android devices
-	Android: Create user applications using the Kotlin language with Android Studio, Applications are designed to have real-time connections using firebase, Applications will experience a buffer if they are not connected to the internet, create dummy page backend applications and Use APIs from the Wecare website.
-	Cloud: Create a Wecare website and deploy the website using the app engine and the database using Cloud Sql, and create a chatbot with dialogflow then integrate it into the Wecare website
